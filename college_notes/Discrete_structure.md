# Logic
So in logic we can find a mathematical flow of, well, logic. like if something happens then it has a cause. following a: "if this happens then that will happen" kind of flow.
we have logical operations that is not only used in mathematics and computers but i noticed that the topic of "logic" is often used by logical peoples like detective. liek for something to happen, there must be a reason, a cause. 

So, what does that mean? well we should learn about logic and formal logic,its a structure to give us a eay of thinking, logical thinking.

We have operators like ***And*** for each condition must be true to have a true, or correct tag or result, thiss helps us to know what must always be true together.
Then we have ***Or*** operator, where we can predict and demonstrate their options, any one can happen, if not then that whole thing or sentence is unvalid, false or incorrect.
And we have a really simple but really immportent operator, ***Not*** operator, this just negates the sentance, but its often so amazing to watch it on complex sentances, like the double negation. Where a false statement is asked in a way so it gets negated again, and the sentence gives true sentence
For example there is this riddle of two gate keeper, of which one always tells the truth and one always false (negated), you dont know who is who, and you need to choose between two doors of which one is safe another unsafe. You need to create a sentence that works same with both. One that negates the truth, one that tells the truth without negation.
So you need to pass the door shoice through both of them, so we always have a negated sentence, like asking any one guard, "what will the other guard tell if i ask him which door is the safe one?".
try thinking how it may work....
